# Windy-X-Gemini
Windy UI x Gemini is a smart tool built for developers and designers to quickly generate and reuse modern UI components. With just a prompt, users can instantly generate clean, responsive UI elements, or simply browse and copy ready-made components to speed up their workflow.
I collaborated with Yogesh Vashisht on this project as a full-stack developer, focusing on making the application more scalable and highly efficient.
